\chapter{Related Work\label{cha:chapter5}}

There is a large amount of scientific work that has been done on QAT, 
and it can be categorized based on different characteristics, 
separately covered in the sections of this chapter.


\section{Quantization Target Parameters}
In QAT, one of the key decisions relates to which parameters of the NN to quantize.
\section{Granularity of Quantization}
Granularity of quantization refers to the level at which quantization is applied within a neural network.


\section{Handling of Differentiability}
\section{Precision in Quantization}
\section{Integration with Pruning \& Other Techniques}
\section{Modifications to Loss Functions}
